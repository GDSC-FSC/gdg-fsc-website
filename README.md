## 3. Overview
The GDG FSC Website serves as the digital hub for students and developers at Farmingdale State College. It provides a centralized platform for discovering upcoming technical events, exploring community-led projects, and meeting the core team members.

The project addresses the need for a high-performance, maintainable community site that can handle complex data flows (like real-time event updates) while remaining accessible. It utilizes a modern **Nx Monorepo** architecture to share logic between the primary frontend and internal documentation tools.

**Who is this for?**
- **Students:** To stay updated on workshops and hackathons.
- **Lead Organizers:** To manage team profiles and event listings.
- **Contributors:** To learn modern full-stack development using Bun, React, and functional programming patterns (Effect-TS).

---

## 4. Features
### 🚀 Core Experience
- ✨ **Ultra-Fast Rendering:** Powered by Vite and Bun for near-instant page loads.
- 📱 **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Fully offline-capable with custom service workers and manifest.
- 🎨 **Unified Design System:** Atomic UI components built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI.
- 🌓 **Adaptive Theming:** System-aware light/dark mode with smooth transitions.

### 🛠️ Developer-First Tooling
- 📦 **Nx Monorepo:** Shared libraries for decorators, utility classes, and UI components.
- ⚡ **Effect-TS Integration:** Type-safe, functional error handling and dependency injection.
- 🧪 **Multi-Layer Testing:** Unit tests with Vitest and E2E testing with Playwright.
- 🛡️ **Advanced Decorators:** Custom method decorators for `@memoize`, `@rateLimit`, and `@execTime`.

### Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Runtime** | Bun | JavaScript runtime, package manager, and test runner |
| **Framework** | React 18 | Component-based UI rendering |
| **Logic** | Effect-TS | Type-safe functional programming and error management |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS framework |
| **State** | Zustand | Lightweight reactive state management |
| **Infrastructure** | Firebase / Railway | Hosting and CI/CD deployment |

## 6. Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.1.0 or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ (for fallback compatibility)
- Firebase CLI (for deployment)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GDSC-FSC/gdg-fsc-website.git
cd gdg-fsc-website

# Install dependencies using Bun
bun install
```

### Running Locally
```bash
# Start the frontend application
bun nx serve frontend

# Start the documentation site
bun nx serve docs
```
The site will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 7. Usage & Examples

### Using Method Decorators
The shared library provides high-level decorators to optimize class methods.

```typescript
import { memoize, execTime } from '@gdsc-fsc/shared/decorators';

class EventService {
  @execTime() // Logs execution time to console
  @memoize({ ttl: 60000 }) // Caches results for 1 minute
  async fetchUpcomingEvents() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/events');
    return response.json();
  }
}
```

### Implementing an Effect-TS Flow
Server-side logic uses Effect for robust error handling.

```typescript
import { Effect, pipe } from "effect";
import { getEvents } from "./dal/events-dao";

const program = pipe(
  getEvents(),
  Effect.map((events) => events.filter(e => e.isActive)),
  Effect.catchAll((error) => Effect.logError("Failed to fetch events", error))
);

Effect.runPromise(program);
```

<details>
<summary>Advanced: Thread Pool Usage</summary>

For CPU-intensive tasks, use the built-in Thread Pool:
```typescript
import { ThreadPool } from '@gdsc-fsc/shared/classes';

const pool = new ThreadPool({ size: 4 });
const task = async () => { /* heavy logic */ };
await pool.execute(task);
```
</details>

## 8. Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in `apps/frontend/`.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Yes | - | Firebase public API key |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | No | `/api` | Base URL for backend requests |
| `VITE_APP_ENV` | No | `development` | `production`, `staging`, or `development` |

### Firebase Config
The project uses `firebase.json` for hosting configurations, including custom headers for PWA caching and security policies.
