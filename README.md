## Overview

The **GDG on Campus Farmingdale State College Website** serves as the digital headquarters for our student developer community. The project is designed to bridge the gap between academic learning and professional software engineering by providing a real-world platform where students can track events, collaborate on projects, and manage community leadership.

The solution addresses the need for a central hub that is both a high-performance consumer-facing application and a robust playground for testing advanced architectural patterns like Monorepos, PWA capabilities, and distributed tracing.

**Who is this for?**
- **Student Members:** To discover upcoming workshops, hackathons, and community projects.
- **Chapter Leads:** To manage event listings and showcase the leadership team.
- **Contributors:** For students looking to gain experience with modern tech stacks (React, Bun, Elysia, Nx).

## Features

### 🎨 Frontend Experience
- ✨ **Dynamic & Responsive UI**: Built with React and optimized with Vite for near-instant load times.
- ⚡ **PWA Support**: Full offline capabilities and installability via `vite-pwa-plugin`.
- 🪄 **Fluid Transitions**: Utilizes the experimental View Transitions API for app-like navigation.
- 🧩 **Shadcn UI & Tailwind**: Beautiful, accessible components with utility-first styling.
- 📈 **Server State**: Robust data fetching and caching using `@tanstack/react-query`.

### ⚙️ Backend & Infrastructure
- 🚀 **Bun-powered Elysia**: High-performance REST API with end-to-end type safety.
- 🛡️ **Security First**: Integrated JWT Bearer auth, CSP headers via Helmet, and rate limiting.
- 🕵️ **Observability**: Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger integration.
- 📦 **Monorepo Architecture**: Managed with Nx for efficient builds and shared logic.

### 🛠️ Shared Utilities (Packages)
- 🧪 **Advanced Decorators**: Method-level logic for memoization, debouncing, and execution timing.
- 🧵 **Multi-threading**: Custom `ThreadPool` and `WorkerThread` implementations for heavy tasks.
- 🔒 **Data Protection**: `Redacted` class for handling sensitive information.

## Architecture

The project follows a Monorepo structure, separating concerns into applications and reusable packages.

### Tech Stack Table
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Runtime** | Bun | JavaScript runtime, package manager, and test runner |
| **Frontend** | React 18+ | UI Framework |
| **Backend** | Elysia.js | High-performance Web Framework |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS |
| **State** | Zustand / React Query | Global and Server-side state management |
| **Observability** | Jaeger / OpenTelemetry | Distributed tracing and monitoring |
| **Testing** | Playwright / Vitest / Cypress | Multi-layer testing strategy |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Bun**: >= 1.1.0 (Required)
- **Node.js**: >= 20.x (For specific tool compatibility)
- **Docker**: For running observability stack (Optional)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GDSC-FSC/gdg-fsc-website.git
cd gdg-fsc-website

# Install dependencies using Bun
bun install
```

### Running Locally
```bash
# Start frontend and backend in development mode
bun run dev

# Start only the frontend
bun run dev:frontend

# Start the observability stack (Jaeger)
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage & Examples

### Using Shared Decorators
The repository provides advanced TypeScript decorators in `@packages/shared`.

```typescript
import { Memoize, ExecTime, Debounce } from '@packages/shared/decorators';

class DataService {
  // Caches result based on arguments
  @Memoize()
  async fetchHeavyData(id: string) {
    // ... logic
  }

  // Logs execution time to console/telemetry
  @ExecTime()
  processAnalytics() {
    // ... logic
  }

  // Limits execution to once every 300ms
  @Debounce(300)
  handleSearch(query: string) {
    // ... logic
  }
}
```

### Data Fetching Example
Standardized data fetching pattern using React Query and the internal API client.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { eventsService } from '@/server/service';

export const EventsList = () => {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['events'],
    queryFn: () => eventsService.getAllEvents()
  });

  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(event => <EventCard key={event.id} {...event} />)}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Configuration
