Once created, a `HashSet` cannot be modified;\n * any operation that would alter the set instead returns a new `HashSet` with\n * the changes. This immutability offers benefits like predictable state\n * management and easier reasoning about your code.\n *\n * ## What Problem Does It Solve?\n *\n * `HashSet` solves the problem of maintaining an unsorted collection where each\n * value appears exactly once, with fast operations for checking membership and\n * adding/removing values.\n *\n * ## When to Use\n *\n * Use `HashSet` when you need:\n *\n * - A collection with no duplicate values\n * - Efficient membership testing (**`O(1)`** average complexity)\n * - Set operations like union, intersection, and difference\n * - An immutable data structure that preserves functional programming patterns\n *\n * ## Advanced Features\n *\n * HashSet provides operations for:\n *\n * - Transforming sets with map and flatMap\n * - Filtering elements with filter\n * - Combining sets with union, intersection and difference\n * - Performance optimizations via mutable operations in controlled contexts\n *\n * ## Performance Characteristics\n *\n * - **Lookup** operations ({@link module:HashSet.has}): **`O(1)`** average time\n *   complexity\n * - **Insertion** operations ({@link module:HashSet.add}): **`O(1)`** average time\n *   complexity\n * - **Removal** operations ({@link module:HashSet.remove}): **`O(1)`** average\n *   time complexity\n * - **Set** operations ({@link module:HashSet.union},\n *   {@link module:HashSet.intersection}): **`O(n)`** where n is the size of the\n *   smaller set\n * - **Iteration**: **`O(n)`** where n is the size of the set\n *\n * The HashSet data structure implements the following traits:\n *\n * - {@link Iterable}: allows iterating over the values in the set\n * - {@link Equal}: allows comparing two sets for value-based equality\n * - {@link Pipeable}: allows chaining operations with the pipe operator\n * - {@link Inspectable}: allows inspecting the contents of the set\n *\n * ## Operations Reference\n *\n * | Category     | Operation                           | Description                                 | Complexity |\n * | ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n * | constructors | {@link module:HashSet.empty}        | Creates an empty HashSet                    | O(1)       |\n * | constructors | {@link module:HashSet.fromIterable} | Creates a HashSet from an iterable          | O(n)       |\n * | constructors | {@link module:HashSet.make}         | Creates a HashSet from multiple values      | O(n)       |\n * |              |                                     |                                             |            |\n * | elements     | {@link module:HashSet.has}          | Checks if a value exists in the set         | O(1) avg   |\n * | elements     | {@link module:HashSet.some}         | Checks if any element satisfies a predicate | O(n)       |\n * | elements     | {@link module:HashSet.every}        | Checks if all elements satisfy a predicate  | O(n)       |\n * | elements     | {@link module:HashSet.isSubset}     | Checks if a set is a subset of another      | O(n)       |\n * |              |                                     |                                             |            |\n * | getters      | {@link module:HashSet.values}       | Gets an iterator of all values              | O(1)       |\n * | getters      | {@link module:HashSet.toValues}     | Gets an array of all values                 | O(n)       |\n * | getters      | {@link module:HashSet.size}         | Gets the number of elements                 | O(1)       |\n * |              |                                     |                                             |            |\n * | mutations    | {@link module:HashSet.add}          | Adds a value to the set                     | O(1) avg   |\n * | mutations    | {@link module:HashSet.remove}       | Removes a value from the set                | O(1) avg   |\n * | mutations    | {@link module:HashSet.toggle}       | Toggles a value's presence                  | O(1) avg   |\n * |              |                                     |                                             |            |\n * | operations   | {@link module:HashSet.difference}   | Computes set difference (A -

It\n * implements the {@link Iterable}, {@link Equal}, {@link Pipeable}, and\n * {@link Inspectable} traits from Effect. This ensures compatibility with other\n * Effect data structures and functionalities. For example, you can easily use\n * Effect's `pipe` method to chain operations on the `HashSet`.\n *\n * **Equality of Elements with Effect's {@link Equal `Equal`} Trait:**\n *\n * This `HashSet` relies on Effect's {@link Equal} trait to determine the\n * uniqueness of elements within the set. The way equality is checked depends on\n * the type of the elements:\n *\n * - **Primitive Values:** For primitive JavaScript values like strings, numbers,\n *   booleans, `null`, and `undefined`, equality is determined by their value\n *   (similar to the `===` operator).\n * - **Objects and Custom Types:** For objects and other custom types, equality is\n *   determined by whether those types implement the {@link Equal} interface\n *   themselves. If an element type implements `Equal`, the `HashSet` will\n *   delegate to that implementation to perform the equality check. This allows\n *   you to define custom logic for determining when two instances of your\n *   objects should be considered equal based on their properties, rather than\n *   just their object identity.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { Equal, Hash, HashSet } from \"effect\"\n *\n * class Person implements Equal.Equal {\n *   constructor(\n *     readonly id: number, // Unique identifier\n *     readonly name: string,\n *     readonly age: number\n *   ) {}\n *\n *   // Define equality based on id, name, and age\n *   [Equal.symbol](that: Equal.Equal): boolean {\n *     if (that instanceof Person) {\n *       return (\n *         Equal.equals(this.id, that.id) &&\n *         Equal.equals(this.name, that.name) &&\n *         Equal.equals(this.age, that.age)\n *       )\n *     }\n *     return false\n *   }\n *\n *   // Generate a hash code based on the unique id\n *   [Hash.symbol](): number {\n *     return Hash.hash(this.id)\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // Creating a HashSet with objects that implement the Equal interface\n * const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(\n *   HashSet.add(new Person(1, \"Alice\", 30)),\n *   HashSet.add(new Person(1, \"Alice\", 30))\n * )\n *\n * // HashSet recognizes them as equal, so only one element is stored\n * console.log(HashSet.size(set))\n * // Output: 1\n * ```\n *\n * **Simplifying Equality and Hashing with `Data` and `Schema`:**\n *\n * Effect's {@link Data} and {@link Schema `Schema.Data`} modules offer powerful\n * ways to automatically handle the implementation of both the {@link Equal} and\n * {@link Hash} traits for your custom data structures.\n *\n * - **`Data` Module:** By using constructors like `Data.struct`, `Data.tuple`,\n *   `Data.array`, or `Data.case` to define your data types, Effect\n *   automatically generates the necessary implementations for value-based\n *   equality and consistent hashing. This significantly reduces boilerplate and\n *   ensures correctness.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { HashSet, Data, Equal } from \"effect\"\n * import assert from \"node:assert/strict\"\n *\n * // Data.* implements the `Equal` traits for us\n * const person1 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: \"Alice\", age: 30 })\n * const person2 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: \"Alice\", age: 30 })\n *\n * assert(Equal.equals(person1, person2))\n *\n * const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(\n *   HashSet.add(person1),\n *   HashSet.add(person2)\n * )\n *\n * // HashSet recognizes them as equal, so only one element is stored\n * console.log(HashSet.size(set)) // Output: 1\n * ```\n *\n * - **`Schema` Module:** When defining data schemas using the {@link Schema}\n *   module, you can use `Schema.Data` to automatically include the `Equal` and\n *   `Hash` traits in the decoded objects. This is particularly important when\n *   working with `HashSet`. **For decoded objects to be correctly recognized as\n *   equal within a `HashSet`, ensure that the schema for those objects is\n *   defined using `Schema.Data`.**\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { Equal, HashSet, Schema } from \"effect\"\n * import assert from \"node:assert/strict\"\n *\n * // Schema.Data implements the `Equal` traits for us\n * const PersonSchema = Schema.Data(\n *   Schema.Struct({\n *     id: Schema.Number,\n *     name: Schema.String,\n *     age: Schema.Number\n *   })\n * )\n *\n * const Person = Schema.decode(PersonSchema)\n *\n * const person1 = Person({ id: 1, name: \"Alice\", age: 30 })\n * const person2 = Person({ id: 1, name: \"Alice\", age: 30 })\n *\n * assert(Equal.equals(person1, person2)) // Output: true\n *\n * const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(\n *   HashSet.add(person1),\n *   HashSet.add(person2)\n * )\n *\n * // HashSet thanks to Schema.Data implementation of the `Equal` trait, recognizes the two Person as equal, so only one element is stored\n * console.log(HashSet.size(set)) // Output: 1\n * ```\n *\n * ### Interoperability with the JavaScript Runtime:\n *\n * To interoperate with the regular JavaScript runtime, Effect's `HashSet`\n * provides methods to access its elements in formats readily usable by\n * JavaScript APIs: {@link values `HashSet.values`},\n * {@link toValues `HashSet.toValues`}\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { HashSet } from \"effect\"\n *\n * const hashSet: HashSet.HashSet<number> = HashSet.make(1, 2, 3)\n *\n * // Using HashSet.values to convert HashSet.HashSet<A> to IterableIterator<A>\n * const iterable: IterableIterator<number> = HashSet.values(hashSet)\n *\n * console.log(...iterable) // Logs:  1 2 3\n *\n * // Using HashSet.toValues to convert HashSet.HashSet<A> to Array<A>\n * const array: Array<number> = HashSet.toValues(hashSet)\n *\n * console.log(array) // Logs: [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n * ```\n *\n * Be mindful of performance implications (both time and space complexity) when\n * frequently converting between Effect's immutable HashSet and mutable\n * JavaScript data structures, especially for large collections.\n *\n * @module HashSet\n * @since 2.0.0\n */\nexport * as HashSet from \"./HashSet.js\";\n/**\n * @since 2.0.0\n */\nexport * as Inspectable from \"./Inspectable.js\";\n/**\n * This module provides utility functions for working with Iterables in TypeScript.\n *\n * @since 2.0.0\n */\nexport * as Iterable from \"./Iterable.js\";\n/**\n * @since 3.10.0\n */\nexport * as JSONSchema from \"./JSONSchema.js\";\n/**\n * @since 2.0.0\n */\nexport * as KeyedPool from \"./KeyedPool.js\";\n/**\n * A `Layer<ROut, E, RIn>` describes how to build one or more services in your\n * application.

Unlike its immutable sibling\n * {@link module:HashSet}, a `MutableHashSet` can be modified in-place;\n * operations like add, remove, and clear directly modify the original set\n * rather than creating a new one. This mutability offers benefits like improved\n * performance in scenarios where you need to build or modify a set\n * incrementally.\n *\n * ## What Problem Does It Solve?\n *\n * `MutableHashSet` solves the problem of maintaining an unsorted collection\n * where each value appears exactly once, with fast operations for checking\n * membership and adding/removing values, in contexts where mutability is\n * preferred for performance or implementation simplicity.\n *\n * ## When to Use\n *\n * Use `MutableHashSet` when you need:\n *\n * - A collection with no duplicate values\n * - Efficient membership testing (**`O(1)`** average complexity)\n * - In-place modifications for better performance\n * - A set that will be built or modified incrementally\n * - Local mutability in otherwise immutable code\n *\n * ## Advanced Features\n *\n * MutableHashSet provides operations for:\n *\n * - Adding and removing elements with direct mutation\n * - Checking for element existence\n * - Clearing all elements at once\n * - Converting to/from other collection types\n *\n * ## Performance Characteristics\n *\n * - **Lookup** operations ({@link module:MutableHashSet.has}): **`O(1)`** average\n *   time complexity\n * - **Insertion** operations ({@link module:MutableHashSet.add}): **`O(1)`**\n *   average time complexity\n * - **Removal** operations ({@link module:MutableHashSet.remove}): **`O(1)`**\n *   average time complexity\n * - **Iteration**: **`O(n)`** where n is the size of the set\n *\n * The MutableHashSet data structure implements the following traits:\n *\n * - {@link Iterable}: allows iterating over the values in the set\n * - {@link Pipeable}: allows chaining operations with the pipe operator\n * - {@link Inspectable}: allows inspecting the contents of the set\n *\n * ## Operations Reference\n *\n * | Category     | Operation                                  | Description                         | Complexity |\n * | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------- |\n * | constructors | {@link module:MutableHashSet.empty}        | Creates an empty MutableHashSet     | O(1)       |\n * | constructors | {@link module:MutableHashSet.fromIterable} | Creates a set from an iterable      | O(n)       |\n * | constructors | {@link module:MutableHashSet.make}         | Creates a set from multiple values  | O(n)       |\n * |              |                                            |                                     |            |\n * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.has}          | Checks if a value exists in the set | O(1) avg   |\n * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.add}          | Adds a value to the set             | O(1) avg   |\n * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.remove}       | Removes a value from the set        | O(1) avg   |\n * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.size}         | Gets the number of elements         | O(1)       |\n * | elements     | {@link module:MutableHashSet.clear}        | Removes all values from the set     | O(1)       |\n *\n * ## Notes\n *\n * ### Mutability Considerations:\n *\n * Unlike most data structures in the Effect ecosystem, `MutableHashSet` is\n * mutable.

Composition Patterns and Type Safety\n *\n * When building function pipelines, understanding how types flow through\n * operations is critical:\n *\n * ### Composing with type-preserving operations\n *\n * Most operations in this module are type-preserving (`number → number`),\n * making them easily composable in pipelines:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { pipe } from \"effect\"\n * import * as Number from \"effect/Number\"\n *\n * const result = pipe(\n *   10,\n *   Number.increment, // number → number\n *   Number.multiply(2), // number → number\n *   Number.round(1) // number → number\n * ) // Result: number (21)\n * ```\n *\n * ### Working with Option results\n *\n * Operations that might fail (like division by zero) return Option types and\n * require Option combinators:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { pipe, Option } from \"effect\"\n * import * as Number from \"effect/Number\"\n *\n * const result = pipe(\n *   10,\n *   Number.divide(0), // number → Option<number>\n *   Option.getOrElse(() => 0) // Option<number> → number\n * ) // Result: number (0)\n * ```\n *\n * ### Composition best practices\n *\n * - Chain type-preserving operations for maximum composability\n * - Use Option combinators when working with potentially failing operations\n * - Consider using Effect for operations that might fail with specific errors\n * - Remember that all operations maintain JavaScript's floating-point precision\n *   limitations\n *\n * @module Number\n * @since 2.0.0\n * @see {@link module:BigInt} for more similar operations on `bigint` types\n * @see {@link
