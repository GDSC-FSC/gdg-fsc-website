 * - Prevents memory leaks from multiple instances
 * - Maintains consistent query state across the application

 *
 * @remarks
 * This component wraps the application with necessary React Query infrastructure:
 * - QueryClientProvider: Provides the QueryClient instance to all child components
 * - ReactQueryDevtools: Development tools for debugging queries (disabled by default)
 *
 * The QueryClient is managed through getQueryClient() which handles:
 * - Server-side rendering considerations
 * - Client-side singleton management
 * - Proper cache isolation between requests
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <QueryProvider>
 *   <App />
 * </QueryProvider>
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Object} props - Component props
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.children - Child components to be wrapped with the QueryClient context
 * @returns {React.JSX.Element} A QueryClientProvider component with configured QueryClient and dev tools
